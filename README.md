# DySSTV
Dynamic SSTV is a hobby project that will allow the user to encode and decode image files using a custom SSTV protocol, as well as most of the standard protocols. This is mostly an exercise in learning Python and understanding the mathematics behind SSTV. I will do my best to make the code clear and concise with explanations for other users to learn from too.
