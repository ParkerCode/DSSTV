# This file will serve as a structuring document for building the program.
# It is likely this file will change and/or may not represent the final program.

# We will first break down what exactly this program does in a few sentences.
DSSTV will be able to, but is not limited to:
    >Read/Write .jpg, .png, .bmp files.
    >Read/Write .wav, .mp3, .ogg, or other audio formats.
    >Encode images using the standard SSTV protcols:
        Scottie, Martin, Robot, etc...
    >Decode audio using the standard protocols into images.
    >Encode images using a custom protocol that allows custom image sizes
    >Decode audio using that custom protocol.
    >Present easy command-line interface with help section, including man page.
    >Optionally change colorspace and quality of images encoded
    >

How can we easily break this program into classes?
DSSTV.py
    Provides the main start point for the program

ENCODERS
    > These can be stored in their own /src/encoders folder.
Dynamic.py
    Defines custom SSTV protocol, allowing dynamic image sizes. This name will
    be changed to whatever I wind up naming the protocol.
Scottie.py
Martin.py
Robot.py
etc..
